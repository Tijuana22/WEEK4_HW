// }


// // Fizz Buzz
// This is a classic problem that you should get really comfortable solving. If you've solved it before, try to make it more elegant and short.

// for(let y = 0; y < 101; y++)
// if(y % 3 == 0 && y % 5 == 0){
//     console.log('FizzBuzz');
// }else if ( y % 3 === 0){
//     console.log('Fizz');
// }else (y % 5 === 0)
//     console.log('Buzz');



// Wild Wild Life
// Use the following arrays to answer the questions below (name,species ,age, hometown): You should be modifying the elements by accessing them. It is up to you which methods to use.

const wolfy = ["Wolfy", "wolf", 16, "Yukon Territory"]
const sharky = ["Sharky", "shark", 20, "Left Coast"]
const plantee = ["Plantee", "plant",  5000 , "Mordor"]
const porgee = ["Porgee", "Porg", 186, "Ahch-To"]

// Plantee just had her birthday; change Plantee's array to reflect her being a year older.
// Change Wolfy's hometown from "Yukon Territory" to "Gotham City".
// Give D'Art a second hometown by adding "Hawkins"
// Porgee decides that Wolfy can't be named "Wolfy" anymore. Remove "Wolfy" from the wolfyarray and replace it with "Gameboy".
// ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:
// "Wild Wild Life answered"
